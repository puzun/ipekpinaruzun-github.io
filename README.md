# About

I currently work as an Associate Professor in the Department of Linguistics at Ankara University. My research interests include acoustic phonetics, stress perception, prosody-syntax interaction, and the neural bases of prosody. I use methods such as acoustic analyses, EEG, eye-tracking, and pupillometry. I conduct my studies and lead my research group at the Phonetics Lab in Ankara University Brain Research Centre (AUBAUM), NÖROM, and Ankara University Linguistic Lab (diLab).

I completed my fellowship in 2014 with the TUBITAK BIDEB 2214/A International PhD Fellowship at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany. My supervisors were Angela D. Friederici and Daniela Sammler at the Otto Hahn Research Group. During my fellowship, I studied the ERP processing of prosody-syntax interaction at the post-verbal position in Turkish sentences.

Subsequently, I completed my post-doc on the acoustic characteristics of compound-phrase distinction in Turkish using the BIDEB 2219 Post-Doc Research Fellowship in the Phonetics Group at Saarland University, under the supervision of Bernd Möbius.
